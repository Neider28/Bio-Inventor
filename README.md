#Bio Inventor ðŸ’»
This is my first project focused on the internet of things. The main objective of this project is to monitor and control the inventory of thermolabile drugs, which in this case are vaccines, since these types of products must be in special temperature conditions. In addition to helping the user to know the amount of products available in the inventory. Technologies such as Arduino Uno and AppInventor were implemented for its development due to its ease of use and compatibility. This was implemented in a mini fridge to simulate its operation. In the following link you can see its operation in real time: [Video Bio Inventor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18L_bRG2Vo4cMt3jWLUcSypBK7weEj_ie/view?usp=sharing "Video Bio Inventor")
